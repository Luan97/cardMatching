# About CardMatching
Card matching game code base
This card matching game is just a fun small project for me to modify & test Api Service Manager that I was creating. 
The images are sourced from Pexels' free stock photo services (https://www.pexels.com/) to test out Authorization token.

Nice to have in the future:
1. Launch screen animation
2. Two players mechanism
3. Different theme for displaying card
4. Leaderboard + database integration
5. Unit Test
